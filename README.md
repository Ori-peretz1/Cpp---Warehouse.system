This repository features a C++ simulation of a Wharehouse system, designed to manage and process package orders through various operational stages until delivery to the client.
The system employs multiple types of volunteers, such as delivery personnel and packers, who play essential roles in the order fulfillment process.
This project serves not only to implement a practical application using C++ but also to explore memory management techniques to prevent memory leaks.
Proper use of pointers and adherence to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles are key focuses, ensuring robust and efficient code.
Through this simulation, I have demonstrated advanced C++ features and OOP design patterns to create a dynamic and functional food bank system.
